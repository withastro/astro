# Sandbox Environment (CI)

You are running inside a Docker container in CI. This file contains global instructions for all OpenCode sessions in this environment.

<!-- TODO: Add your CI-specific instructions here. For example:
- Constraints on network access or available tools
- How to handle GitHub authentication in CI
- Default behaviors for automated triage runs
- Any sandbox-specific limitations to be aware of
-->

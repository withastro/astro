# @astrojs/vercel

## 9.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#14555](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/14555) [`5601357`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/56013574348b366a5eafa82519f4bdf532df80ae) Thanks [@jacobdalamb](https://github.com/jacobdalamb)! - Updates Node v18 'retiring' notice to 'deprecated' for Vercel adapter.

### Minor Changes

- [#14543](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/14543) [`9b3241d`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/9b3241d8a903ce0092905205af883cef5498d0b2) Thanks [@matthewp](https://github.com/matthewp)! - Enables skew protection for Astro sites deployed on Vercel. Skew protection ensures that your site's client and server versions stay synchronized during deployments, preventing issues where users might load assets from a newer deployment while the server is still running the older version.

  Skew protection is automatically enabled on Vercel deployments when the `VERCEL_SKEW_PROTECTION_ENABLED` environment variable is set to `1`. The deployment ID is automatically included in both asset requests and API calls, allowing Vercel to serve the correct version to every user.

## 8.2.11

### Patch Changes

- [#14570](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/14570) [`c96711d`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/c96711d661c1beb7534a0c1d6b4fe806e656c13b) Thanks [@matthewp](https://github.com/matthewp)! - Fix regression in 8.2.7: validate densities-based srcset widths against configured sizes

  When using `densities` with the Vercel image adapter, calculated widths were not being validated against Vercel's configured sizes list. This caused images to fail when using densities, as Vercel would reject the invalid widths.

  This fix ensures densities-calculated widths are mapped to valid configured sizes, matching the behavior already implemented for the `widths` prop.

## 8.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#13965](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/13965) [`95ece06`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/95ece0663ed160687ef21101f84b2adec0bffd01) Thanks [@ematipico](https://github.com/ematipico)! - Adds support for the [experimental static headers Astro feature](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/adapter-reference/#experimentalstaticheaders).

  When the feature is enabled via option `experimentalStaticHeaders`, and [experimental Content Security Policy](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/experimental-flags/csp/) is enabled, the adapter will generate `Response` headers for static pages, which allows support for CSP directives that are not supported inside a `<meta>` tag (e.g. `frame-ancestors`).

  ```js
  import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
  import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel';

  export default defineConfig({
    adapter: vercel({
      experimentalStaticHeaders: true,
    }),
    experimental: {
      cps: true,
    },
  });
  ```

### Patch Changes

- [#13917](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/13917) [`e615216`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/e615216c55bca5d61b8c5c1b49d62671f0238509) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - The responsive images feature introduced behind a flag in [v5.0.0](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/CHANGELOG.md#500) is no longer experimental and is available for general use.

  The new responsive images feature in Astro automatically generates optimized images for different screen sizes and resolutions, and applies the correct attributes to ensure that images are displayed correctly on all devices.

  Enable the `image.responsiveStyles` option in your Astro config. Then, set a `layout` attribute on any <Image /> or <Picture /> component, or configure a default `image.layout`, for instantly responsive images with automatically generated `srcset` and `sizes` attributes based on the image's dimensions and the layout type.

  Displaying images correctly on the web can be challenging, and is one of the most common performance issues seen in sites. This new feature simplifies the most challenging part of the process: serving your site visitor an image optimized for their viewing experience, and for your website's performance.

  For full details, see the updated [Image guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#responsive-image-behavior).

  #### Migration from Experimental Responsive Images

  The `experimental.responsiveImages` flag has been removed, and all experimental image configuration options have been renamed to their final names.

  If you were using the experimental responsive images feature, you'll need to update your configuration:

  ##### Remove the experimental flag

  ```diff
  export default defineConfig({
     experimental: {
  -    responsiveImages: true,
     },
  });
  ```

  ##### Update image configuration options

  During the experimental phase, default styles were applied automatically to responsive images. Now, you need to explicitly set the `responsiveStyles` option to `true` if you want these styles applied.

  ```diff
  export default defineConfig({
    image: {
  +    responsiveStyles: true,
    },
  });
  ```

  The experimental image configuration options have been renamed:

  **Before:**

  ```js
  export default defineConfig({
    image: {
      experimentalLayout: 'constrained',
      experimentalObjectFit: 'cover',
      experimentalObjectPosition: 'center',
      experimentalBreakpoints: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1280],
      experimentalDefaultStyles: true,
    },
    experimental: {
      responsiveImages: true,
    },
  });
  ```

  **After:**

  ```js
  export default defineConfig({
    image: {
      layout: 'constrained',
      objectFit: 'cover',
      objectPosition: 'center',
      breakpoints: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1280],
      responsiveStyles: true, // This is now *false* by default
    },
  });
  ```

  ##### Component usage remains the same

  The `layout`, `fit`, and `position` props on `<Image>` and `<Picture>` components work exactly the same as before:

  ```astro
  <Image
    src={myImage}
    alt="A responsive image"
    layout="constrained"
    fit="cover"
    position="center"
  />
  ```

  If you weren't using the experimental responsive images feature, no changes are required.

  Please see the [Image guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#responsive-image-behavior) for more information on using responsive images in Astro.

  Previously, excluding a page from ISR required explicitly listing it in `isr.exclude`. As websites grew larger, maintaining this list became increasingly difficult, especially for multiple API routes and pages that needed server-side rendering.

  To address this, ISR exclusions now support regular expressions, allowing for more flexible and scalable configurations.

  ```js
  // astro.config.mjs
  import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/serverless';

  export default defineConfig({
    output: 'server',
    adapter: vercel({
      isr: {
        exclude: [
          '/preview', // Excludes a specific route (e.g., pages/preview.astro)
          '/auth/[page]', // Excludes a dynamic route (e.g., pages/auth/[page].astro)
          /^\/api\/.+/, // Excludes all routes starting with /api/
        ],

### Major Changes

- [#11679](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/11679) [`ea71b90`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/ea71b90c9c08ddd1d3397c78e2e273fb799f7dbd) Thanks [@florian-lefebvre](https://github.com/florian-lefebvre)! - Adds stable support for `astro:env`

- [#11770](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/11770) [`cfa6a47`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/cfa6a47ac7a541f99fdad46a68d0cca6e5816cd5) Thanks [@Princesseuh](https://github.com/Princesseuh)! - Removed support for the Squoosh image service. As the underlying library `libsquoosh` is no longer maintained, and the image service sees very little usage we have decided to remove it from Astro.

  Our recommendation is to use the base Sharp image service, which is more powerful, faster, and more actively maintained.

  ```diff
  - import { squooshImageService } from "astro/config";
  import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

  export default defineConfig({
  -  image: {
  -    service: squooshImageService()
  -  }
  });
  ```

  If you are using this service, and cannot migrate to the base Sharp image service, a third-party extraction of the previous service is available here: https://github.com/Princesseuh/astro-image-service-squoosh

- [#11783](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/11783) [`fc81b01`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/fc81b01bcdd43646bcc615b16bf0400a646445c8) Thanks [@matthewp](https://github.com/matthewp)! - Prevent race condition with Node 18

  Using Node 18 there can be a race condition where polyfill for the `crypto` global is not applied in time. This change ensures the polyfills run first.

## 8.0.0-alpha.0

### Major Changes

- [#11714](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/11714) [`8a53517`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/8a5351737d6a14fc55f1dafad8f3b04079e81af6) Thanks [@matthewp](https://github.com/matthewp)! - Remove support for functionPerRoute

  This change removes support for the `functionPerRoute` option both in Astro and `@astrojs/vercel`.

  This option made it so that each route got built as separate entrypoints so that they could be loaded as separate functions. The hope was that by doing this it would decrease the size of each function. However in practice routes use most of the same code, and increases in function size limitations made the potential upsides less important.

  Additionally there are downsides to functionPerRoute, such as hitting limits on the number of functions per project. The feature also never worked with some Astro features like i18n domains and request rewriting.

  Given this, the feature has been removed from Astro.

  This option is now deprecated, and will be removed entirely in Astro v5.0. We suggest removing this option from your configuration as soon as you are able to:

  ```diff
  import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
  import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/serverless';

  export default defineConfig({
    // ...

- [#9987](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/9987) [`0699f34d5c4481c027c4d29d73944f79f97008df`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/0699f34d5c4481c027c4d29d73944f79f97008df) Thanks [@lilnasy](https://github.com/lilnasy)! - Implements verification for edge middleware. This is a security measure to ensure that your serverless functions are only ever called by your edge middleware and not a third party.

  When `edgeMiddleware` is enabled, the serverless function will now respond with `403 Forbidden` for requests that are not verified to have come from the generated edge middleware. No user action is necessary.

## 7.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#9714](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/9714) [`e2fe51c828dc7ea8204788e59e3953fe36c97836`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/e2fe51c828dc7ea8204788e59e3953fe36c97836) Thanks [@lilnasy](https://github.com/lilnasy)! - Introduces a new config option, `isr`, that allows you to deploy your project as an ISR function. [ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration) caches your on-demand rendered pages in the same way as prerendered pages after first request.

  To enable this feature, set `isr` to true in your Vercel adapter configuration in `astro.config.mjs`:

  ```js
  export default defineConfig({
    output: 'server',
    adapter: vercel({ isr: true }),
  });
  ```

  ## Cache invalidation options

  By default, ISR responses are cached for the duration of your deployment. You can further control caching by setting an `expiration` time or prevent caching entirely for certain routes.

  ### Time-based invalidation

  You can change the length of time to cache routes this by configuring an `expiration` value in seconds:

  ```js
  export default defineConfig({
    output: 'server',
    adapter: vercel({
      isr: {
        // caches all pages on first request and saves for 1 day
        expiration: 60 * 60 * 24,
      },
    }),
  });
  ```

  ### Manual invalidation

  To implement Vercel's [Draft mode](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3/features#draft-mode), or [On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3/features#on-demand-incremental-static-regeneration-isr), you can create a bypass token and provide it to the `isr` config along with the paths to exclude from caching:

  ```js
  export default defineConfig({
    output: 'server',
    adapter: vercel({
      isr: {
        // A secret random string that you create.
        bypassToken: '005556d774a8',
        // Paths that will always be served fresh.
        exclude: ['/api/invalidate'],
      },
    }),
  });
  ```

  The Vercel adapter has a file-tracer it uses to detect which files should be moved over to the `dist/` folder. When it's done, it prints warnings for things that it detected that maybe should be moved.

  This change expands how we do ignores so that:
  - Ignores happen within dot folders like `.pnpm`.
  - `@libsql/client` is ignored, a package we know is not bundled.

### Major Changes

- [#8445](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/8445) [`91380378c`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/91380378cef545656d2c085117fc5f38c9ce4589) Thanks [@Princesseuh](https://github.com/Princesseuh)! - Adds a configuration option `devImageService` to choose which of the built-in image services to use in development. Defaults to `sharp`.

- [#8546](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/8546) [`b79e11f3c`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/b79e11f3c480e8e165d5b102adb1f2f8a089f29d) Thanks [@matthewp](https://github.com/matthewp)! - Turn off `functionPerRoute` by default

  In the previous version of `@astrojs/vercel`, the default for `functionPerRoute` was changed to `true`. While this option has several advantages, if you're a free tier user you are likely to run into the limit of 12 functions per deployment. This will result in an error when you attempt to deploy.

  For this reason, the `functionPerRoute` option is now back to defaulting to `false`. It's still a useful option if you have a paid plan and have previously run into issues with your single function exceeding the size limits.

### Minor Changes

- [#8021](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/8021) [`2e8726fee`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/2e8726feec2e0d6ba8bd4db941009986e8e34141) Thanks [@chriswdmr](https://github.com/chriswdmr)! - Enable Vercel Speed Insights and Vercel Web Analytics individually.
  Deprecates the `analytics` property in `astro.config.mjs` in favor of `speedInsights` and `webAnalytics`.

  If you're using the `analytics` property, you'll need to update your config to use the new properties:

  ```diff
  // astro.config.mjs
  export default defineConfig({
  	adapter: vercel({
  -		analytics: true,
  +		webAnalytics: {
  +			enabled: true
  +		},
  +		speedInsights: {
  +			enabled: true
  +		}
  	})
  });
  ```

  Allow configuration of Web Analytics with all available configuration options.
  Bumps @vercel/analytics package to the latest version.

  export default defineConfig({
   output: 'server',
   adapter: vercel({
  +    edgeMiddleware: true
   }),
  });
  ```

  This adapter had several known limitations and compatibility issues that prevented many people from using it in production. To reduce maintenance costs and because we have a better story with Serveless + Edge Middleware, we are removing the Edge adapter.

- [#8239](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/8239) [`52f0837bd`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/52f0837bdeca0b54e07cbf76a7570bd042b98922) Thanks [@matthewp](https://github.com/matthewp)! - Vercel adapter now defaults to `functionPerRoute`.

  With this change, `@astrojs/vercel/serverless` now splits each route into its own function. By doing this, the size of each function is reduced and startup time is faster.

  You can disable this option, which will cause the code to be bundled into a single function, by setting `functionPerRoute` to `false`.

- [#8188](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/8188) [`148e61d24`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/148e61d2492456811f8a3c8daaab1c3429a2ffdc) Thanks [@ematipico](https://github.com/ematipico)! - Reduced the amount of polyfills provided by Astro. Astro will no longer provide (no-op) polyfills for several web apis such as HTMLElement, Image or Document. If you need access to those APIs on the server, we recommend using more proper polyfills available on npm.

### Minor Changes

- [#8188](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/8188) [`cd2d7e769`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/cd2d7e76981ef9b9013453aa2629838e1e9fd422) Thanks [@ematipico](https://github.com/ematipico)! - Introduced the concept of feature map. A feature map is a list of features that are built-in in Astro, and an Adapter
  can tell Astro if it can support it.

  ```ts
  import { AstroIntegration } from './astro';

  function myIntegration(): AstroIntegration {
    return {
      name: 'astro-awesome-list',
      // new feature map
      supportedAstroFeatures: {
        hybridOutput: 'experimental',
        staticOutput: 'stable',
        serverOutput: 'stable',
        assets: {
          supportKind: 'stable',
          isSharpCompatible: false,
          isSquooshCompatible: false,
        },
      },
    };
  }
  ```

- [#8188](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/8188) [`80f1494cd`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/80f1494cdaf72e58a420adb4f7c712d4089e1923) Thanks [@ematipico](https://github.com/ematipico)! - The `build.split` and `build.excludeMiddleware` configuration options are deprecated and have been replaced by options in the adapter config.

  If your config includes the `build.excludeMiddleware` option, replace it with `edgeMiddleware` in your adapter options:

  ```diff
  import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
  import vercel from "@astrojs/vercel/serverless";

  export default defineConfig({
       build: {
  -        excludeMiddleware: true
       },
       adapter: vercel({
  +        edgeMiddleware: true
       }),
  });
  ```

  If your config includes the `build.split` option, replace it with `functionPerRoute` in your adapter options:

  ```diff
  import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
  import vercel from "@astrojs/vercel/serverless";

  export default defineConfig({
       build: {
  -        split: true
       },
       adapter: vercel({
  +        functionPerRoute: true
       }),
  });
  ```

### Major Changes

- [#8015](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/8015) [`9cc4e48e6`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/9cc4e48e6a858d3a12e6373a5e287b32d24a1c5a) Thanks [@matthewp](https://github.com/matthewp)! - Remove the Vercel Edge adapter

  `@astrojs/vercel/serverless` now supports Edge middleware, so a separate adapter for Edge itself (deploying your entire app to the edge) is no longer necessary. Please update your Astro config to reflect this change:

  ```diff
  // astro.config.mjs
  import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
  - import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/edge';
  + import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/serverless';

  export default defineConfig({
   output: 'server',
   adapter: vercel({
  +    edgeMiddleware: true
   }),
  });
  ```

  This adapter had several known limitations and compatibility issues that prevented many people from using it in production. To reduce maintenance costs and because we have a better story with Serveless + Edge Middleware, we are removing the Edge adapter.

### Major Changes

- [`1eae2e3f7`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/1eae2e3f7d693c9dfe91c8ccfbe606d32bf2fb81) Thanks [@Princesseuh](https://github.com/Princesseuh)! - Remove support for Node 16. The lowest supported version by Astro and all integrations is now v18.14.1. As a reminder, Node 16 will be deprecated on the 11th September 2023.

- [`c022a4217`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/c022a4217a805d223c1494e9eda4e48bbf810388) Thanks [@Princesseuh](https://github.com/Princesseuh)! - When using an adapter that supports neither Squoosh or Sharp, Astro will now automatically use an image service that does not support processing, but still provides the other benefits of `astro:assets` such as enforcing `alt`, no CLS etc to users

- [`3dc1ca2fa`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/3dc1ca2fac8d9965cc5085a5d09e72ed87b4281a) Thanks [@Princesseuh](https://github.com/Princesseuh)! - Reduced the amount of polyfills provided by Astro. Astro will no longer provide (no-op) polyfills for several web apis such as HTMLElement, Image or Document. If you need access to those APIs on the server, we recommend using more proper polyfills available on npm.

### Minor Changes

- [`9b4f70a62`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/9b4f70a629f55e461759ba46f68af7097a2e9215) Thanks [@ematipico](https://github.com/ematipico)! - Introduced the concept of feature map. A feature map is a list of features that are built-in in Astro, and an Adapter
  can tell Astro if it can support it.

  ```ts
  import { AstroIntegration } from './astro';

  function myIntegration(): AstroIntegration {
    return {
      name: 'astro-awesome-list',
      // new feature map
      supportedAstroFeatures: {
        hybridOutput: 'experimental',
        staticOutput: 'stable',
        serverOutput: 'stable',
        assets: {
          supportKind: 'stable',
          isSharpCompatible: false,
          isSquooshCompatible: false,
        },
      },
    };
  }
  ```

- [`3fdf509b2`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/3fdf509b2731a9b2f972d89291e57cf78d62c769) Thanks [@ematipico](https://github.com/ematipico)! - The `build.split` and `build.excludeMiddleware` configuration options are deprecated and have been replaced by options in the adapter config.

  If your config includes the `build.excludeMiddleware` option, replace it with `edgeMiddleware` in your adapter options:

  ```diff
  import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
  import vercel from "@astrojs/vercel/serverless";

  export default defineConfig({
       build: {
  -        excludeMiddleware: true
       },
       adapter: vercel({
  +        edgeMiddleware: true
       }),
  });
  ```

  If your config includes the `build.split` option, replace it with `functionPerRoute` in your adapter options:

  ```diff
  import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
  import vercel from "@astrojs/vercel/serverless";

  export default defineConfig({
       build: {
  -        split: true
       },
       adapter: vercel({
  +        functionPerRoute: true
       }),
  });
  ```

### Minor Changes

- [#7514](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/7514) [`154af8f5e`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/154af8f5ead25b3cf100cfd445329bd1d3fe876a) Thanks [@matthewp](https://github.com/matthewp)! - Split support in Vercel Serverless

  The Vercel adapter builds to a single function by default. Astro 2.7 added support for splitting your build into separate entry points per page. If you use this configuration the Vercel adapter will generate a separate function for each page. This can help reduce the size of each function so they are only bundling code used on that page.

  ```js
  // astro.config.mjs
  import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
  import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/serverless';

  export default defineConfig({
    output: 'server',
    adapter: vercel(),
    build: {
      split: true,
    },
  });
  ```

  The ability to customize SSR build configuration more granularly is now available in Astro. You can now customize the output folder for `server` (the server code for SSR), `client` (your client-side JavaScript and assets), and `serverEntry` (the name of the entrypoint server module). Here are the defaults:

  ```js
  import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

  export default defineConfig({
    output: 'server',
    build: {
      server: './dist/server/',
      client: './dist/client/',
      serverEntry: 'entry.mjs',
    },
  });
  ```

  These new configuration options are only supported in SSR mode and are ignored when building to SSG (a static site).

  ## Integration hook change

  The integration hook `astro:build:start` includes a param `buildConfig` which includes all of these same options. You can continue to use this param in Astro 1.x, but it is deprecated in favor of the new `build.config` options. All of the built-in adapters have been updated to the new format. If you have an integration that depends on this param we suggest upgrading to do this instead:

  ```js
  export default function myIntegration() {
    return {
      name: 'my-integration',
      hooks: {
        'astro:config:setup': ({ updateConfig }) => {
          updateConfig({
            build: {
              server: '...',
            },
          });
        },
      },
    };
  }
  ```

### Minor Changes

- [#4876](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/4876) [`d3091f89e`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/d3091f89e92fcfe1ad48daca74055d54b1c853a3) Thanks [@matthewp](https://github.com/matthewp)! - Adds the Astro.cookies API

  `Astro.cookies` is a new API for manipulating cookies in Astro components and API routes.

  In Astro components, the new `Astro.cookies` object is a map-like object that allows you to get, set, delete, and check for a cookie's existence (`has`):

  ```astro
  ---
  type Prefs = {
    darkMode: boolean;
  };

  Astro.cookies.set<Prefs>(
    'prefs',
    { darkMode: true },
    {
      expires: '1 month',
    },
  );

  const prefs = Astro.cookies.get<Prefs>('prefs').json();
  ---

  <body data-theme={prefs.darkMode ? 'dark' : 'light'}></body>
  ```

  Once you've set a cookie with Astro.cookies it will automatically be included in the outgoing response.

  This API is also available with the same functionality in API routes:

  ```js
  export function post({ cookies }) {
    cookies.set('loggedIn', false);

    return new Response(null, {
      status: 302,
      headers: {
        Location: '/login',
      },
    });
  }
  ```

  See [the RFC](https://github.com/withastro/rfcs/blob/main/proposals/0025-cookie-management.md) to learn more.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#4015](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/4015) [`6fd161d76`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/6fd161d7691cbf9d3ffa4646e46059dfd0940010) Thanks [@matthewp](https://github.com/matthewp)! - New `output` configuration option

  This change introduces a new "output target" configuration option (`output`). Setting the output target lets you decide the format of your final build, either:
  - `"static"` (default): A static site. Your final build will be a collection of static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) that you can deploy to any static site host.
  - `"server"`: A dynamic server application. Your final build will be an application that will run in a hosted server environment, generating HTML dynamically for different requests.

  If `output` is omitted from your config, the default value `"static"` will be used.

  When using the `"server"` output target, you must also include a runtime adapter via the `adapter` configuration. An adapter will _adapt_ your final build to run on the deployed platform of your choice (Netlify, Vercel, Node.js, Deno, etc).

  To migrate: No action is required for most users. If you currently define an `adapter`, you will need to also add `output: 'server'` to your config file to make it explicit that you are building a server. Here is an example of what that change would look like for someone deploying to Netlify:

  ```diff
  import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
  import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify/functions';

  export default defineConfig({
    adapter: netlify(),
  + output: 'server',
  });
  ```

  The new `Astro.clientAddress` property allows you to get the IP address of the requested user.

  ```astro

  ```

  This property is only available when building for SSR, and only if the adapter you are using supports providing the IP address. If you attempt to access the property in a SSG app it will throw an error.

[See the README to get started](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/integrations/vercel#readme).
  - `trailingSlash` redirects works without a `vercel.json` file: just configure them inside your `astro.config.mjs`
  - Multiple deploy targets: `edge`, `serverless` and `static`!
  - When building to `serverless`, your code isn't transpiled to CJS anymore.

  **Migrate from v0.1**
  1. Change the import inside `astro.config.mjs`:
     ```diff
     - import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel';
     + import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/serverless';
     ```
  2. Rename the `ENABLE_FILE_SYSTEM_API` environment variable to `ENABLE_VC_BUILD`, as Vercel changed it.
  3. The output folder changed from `.output` to `.vercel/output` — you may need to update your `.gitignore`.

Philae was a robotic European Space Agency lander that accompanied the Rosetta spacecraft. It achieved the first-ever soft landing on a comet nucleus when it touched down on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in November 2014. Despite its short operational life, Philae provided unique data about the comet's composition and structure.

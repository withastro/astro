The tests in this folder are done directly on a deployed Netlify website (hosted at https://curious-boba-495d6d.netlify.app) and are not run by the test suite. They instead run every week through a GitHub action.

The purpose of those tests is to make sure that everything works as expected while deployed. In a way, they're as E2E as it gets.

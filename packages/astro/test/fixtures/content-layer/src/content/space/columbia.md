## Columbia

Space Shuttle Columbia (Orbiter Vehicle Designation: OV-102) was the first space-rated orbiter in NASA's Space Shuttle fleet. It launched for the first time on mission STS-1 on April 12, 1981, the first flight of the Space Shuttle program. Over 22 years of service, it completed 27 missions before disintegrating during re-entry near the end of its 28th mission, STS-107 on February 1, 2003, resulting in the deaths of all seven crew members.

Columbia was named after the American sloop Columbia Rediviva which, from 1787 to 1793, under the command of Captain Robert Gray, explored the US Pacific Northwest and became the first American vessel to circumnavigate the globe. It is also named after the Command Module of Apollo 11, the first crewed landing on another celestial body. Columbia

Columbia was the first space shuttle to reach space, on mission STS-1. It was also the first space shuttle to be launched more than once, with a total of 28 missions flown over 22 years. In 2003, Columbia was destroyed as it re-entered Earth's atmosphere, killing all seven crew members. The disaster led to the grounding of the space shuttle fleet for over two years, and the eventual retirement of the remaining orbiters.

The Rosalind Franklin rover is a planned robotic Mars rover, part of the ExoMars mission led by the European Space Agency and the Russian space agency Roscosmos. The mission is scheduled to launch in September 2022, and the rover is expected to land on Mars in June 2023. The rover is named after the British biophysicist Rosalind Franklin, who made key contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA.

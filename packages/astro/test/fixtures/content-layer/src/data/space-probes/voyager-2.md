Voyager 2 is a space probe launched by NASA as part of the Voyager program to study the outer Solar System and interstellar space. Despite being launched 16 days before Voyager 1, it's named Voyager 2 due to its slower trajectory. It's the only spacecraft to have visited all four gas giant planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. After completing its planetary mission, Voyager 2 continued on to study the outer reaches of the Solar System and entered interstellar space in 2018, becoming the second human-made object to do so after Voyager 1.

 * Register a trace listener that will be called on every trace event.
 *
 * The listener can optionally be associated with an AbortSignal to
 * automatically remove it when the signal is aborted.
 * If the signal is already aborted or is aborting, the listener will not be registered.
 *
 * Listeners are called in the order they are registered.
 * Each listener receives the trace event and a `next` callback.
 * Calling the `next` callback will invoke the next listener in the chain,
 * or the traced function if there are no more listeners.
 *
 * Not calling `next` means the next listener or the traced function will
 * be called automatically after the current listener returns.
 * Calling `next` multiple times will have no effect after the first call,
 * the same value or error will be returned to the caller without invoking
 * the next listener or the traced function again.
 *
 * Since trace events can describe both synchronous and asynchronous operations,
 * listeners MUST invoke the `next` function synchronously if they ever do invoke it.
 * A listener must not return a promise that can reject, such a promise rejection
 * will not be handled and trigger an unhandled promise rejection error on the runtime.
 *
 * @param listener The listener function to register.
 * @param signal An optional AbortSignal to remove the listener when aborted.

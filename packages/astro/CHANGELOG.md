## 0.15.5

### Patch Changes

- 7b4c97c: Adds support for `hydrationPolyfills` in renderers

  Renderers can not specify polyfills that must run before the component code runs for hydration:

  ```js
  export default {
    name: '@matthewp/my-renderer',
    server: './server.js',
    client: './client.js',
    hydrationPolyfills: ['./my-polyfill.js'],
  };
  ```

  These will still wait for hydration to occur, but will run before the component script does.

### Patch Changes

- 8865158: Fixes postcss bug with the 'from' property

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- a136c85: **This is a breaking change!**

  Astro props are now accessed from the `Astro.props` global. This change is meant to make prop definitions more ergonomic, leaning into JavaScript patterns you already know (destructuring and defaults). Astro components previously used a prop syntax borrowed from [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/docs#1_export_creates_a_component_prop), but it became clear that this was pretty confusing for most users.

  ```diff
   ---
  + const { text = 'Hello world!' } = Astro.props;
  - export let text = 'Hello world!';
   ---

   <div>{text}</div>
  ```

  [Read more about the `.astro` syntax](https://github.com/snowpackjs/astro/blob/main/docs/syntax.md#data-and-props)

  ***

  ### How do I define what props my component accepts?

  Astro frontmatter scripts are TypeScript! Because of this, we can leverage TypeScript types to define the shape of your props.

  ```ts
  ---
  export interface Props {
    text?: string;
  }
  const { text = 'Hello world!' } = Astro.props as Props;
  ---
  ```

  > **Note** Casting `Astro.props as Props` is a temporary workaround. We expect our Language Server to handle this automatically soon!

  ### How do I access props I haven't explicitly defined?

  One of the great things about this change is that it's straight-forward to access _any_ props. Just use `...props`!

  ```ts
  ---
  export interface Props {
    text?: string;
    [attr: string]: unknown;
  }
  const { text = 'Hello world!', ...props } = Astro.props as Props;
  ---
  ```

  ### What about prop validation?

  We considered building prop validation into Astro, but decided to leave that implementation up to you! This way, you can use any set of tools you like.

  ```ts
  ---
  const { text = 'Hello world!' } = Astro.props;

  if (typeof text !== 'string') throw new Error(`Expected "text" to be of type "string" but recieved "${typeof string}"!`);
  ---
  ```

### Minor Changes

- 8ff7998: Enable Snowpack's [built-in HMR support](https://www.snowpack.dev/concepts/hot-module-replacement) to enable seamless live updates while editing.
- ffb6380: Support for dynamic Markdown through the content attribute.
- 8ff7998: Enabled Snowpack's built-in HMR engine for Astro pages
- 643c880: **This is a breaking change**

  Updated the rendering pipeline for `astro` to truly support any framework.

  For the vast majority of use cases, `astro` should _just work_ out of the box. Astro now depends on `@astrojs/renderer-preact`, `@astrojs/renderer-react`, `@astrojs/renderer-svelte`, and `@astrojs/renderer-vue`, rather than these being built into the core library. This opens the door for anyone to contribute additional renderers for Astro to support their favorite framework, as well as the ability for users to control which renderers should be used.

  **Features**

  - Expose a pluggable interface for controlling server-side rendering and client-side hydration
  - Allows components from different frameworks to be nested within each other.
    > Note: `svelte` currently does support non-destructive hydration, so components from other frameworks cannot currently be nested inside of a Svelte component. See https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/4308.

  **Breaking Changes**

  - To improve compiler performance, improve framework support, and minimize JS payloads, any children passed to hydrated components are automatically wrapped with an `<astro-fragment>` element.

### Patch Changes

- 3d20623: Fixed a bug where Astro did not conform to JSX Expressions' [`&&`](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html#inline-if-with-logical--operator) syntax.

  Also fixed a bug where `<span data-attr="" />` would render as `<span data-attr="undefined" />`.

- 46871d2: Fixed bug where a class attribute was added to the doctype
- c9d833e: Fixed a number of bugs and re-enabled the `@astrojs/renderer-vue` renderer
- ce30bb0: Temporarily disable `@astrojs/renderer-vue` while we investigate an issue with installation
- addd67d: Rename `astroConfig` to `pages` in config. Docs updated.

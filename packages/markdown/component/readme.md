# @astrojs/markdown

This package brings legacy support for the `<Markdown />` component to all Astro projects.

> The `<Markdown />` component does not work in SSR. Consider [importing Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#importing-markdown) instead.
:::

```astro
---
import Markdown from '@astrojs/markdown-component';
---
<Markdown>
  # Markdown syntax is now supported! **Yay!**
</Markdown>
```

See our [Markdown Guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/) for more info.

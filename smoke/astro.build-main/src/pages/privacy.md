The Astro Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Astro website and services. The laws of California and the laws of the United States apply. If you are a resident of EU/EEA, the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses (also referred to as Model Contracts) apply to Trans-Atlantic data transfers.

### General Information

We collect very limited personally identifiable information described below (the “data”) from [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-policy/) and of those who communicate with us directly via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, and information volunteered by the consumer (such as survey information and/or site registrations). The information we collect is used to provide our services, and to improve the quality of our services, and is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've requested when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

- It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of [Terms of Service](/terms), or as otherwise required by law.
- We transfer information about you if Astro is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Astro will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.


### Information Gathering and Usage

Astro uses collected information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication through GitHub, Bitbucket, services improvement, contact, and research. Astro uses personally identifiable information on billing address and/or payment information only for the sole purpose of payment processing for Astro services.

Payment processing services enable us to process payments by credit card, bank transfer or other means. To ensure greater security, we share only the information necessary to execute the transaction with the financial intermediaries handling the transaction. Some of these services may also enable the sending of timed messages to our customer, such as emails containing invoices or notifications concerning the payment.

### Cookies

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.

You can control how websites use cookies by configuring the privacy settings within your browser. Note that if you disable cookies entirely, Astro websites and applications may not function properly.

### Data Storage

Astro uses third-party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run Astro. Astro’s third-party vendors and hosting partners adhere to the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses (also referred to as Model Contracts).

### Data Retention and Deletion

Data is kept for the time necessary to provide the products or services requested by the customer. We keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Astro Service. When you delete your account, we will delete your personal data and it will expire from backups; unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations under the applicable laws to reveal personal data upon reasonable request of public authorities.

### Rights of Data Subjects

Data subject (customer) can always request Astro to allow access and correction, supplement or update of data. Subject to a reasonable request of a data subject, Astro will remove data pertaining to a data subject unless applicable laws impose a duty to retain data for certain time or identification, location and deletion of data imposes a disproportionate financial burden upon Astro. Any requests for access, correction or deletion of data should be directed to Astro by sending an email to [privacy@astro.build](mailto:privacy@astro.build).

You may be aware that a European Union law, called the General Data Protection Regulation or "GDPR" gives certain rights to individuals in relation to their personal data. In order to enable you to exercise these rights with ease in relation to how Astro uses your personal data, we provide you with access to the following settings via your Account Settings page:


- Remove Account - allows you to delete your account and associated personal data; and,
- Notifications - allows you to manage communications you receive from Astro.

As a user you may also request a copy of your data and that your data be updated, deleted, restricted or moved to another organization.

### EU/EEA - US Data Transfers

If you choose to provide Astro with your information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States. Astro uses Google Cloud data hosting services.

On October 6, 2015, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) issued its decision in the case of Maximillian Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner, finding that the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework is invalid with immediate effect. The suspension of Safe Harbor affects many companies that need to transfer personal data from the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) to the United States and to other non-EU/EEA countries. The European Union (EU) is an economic and political partnership between [28 European countries](http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/index_en.htm) that together cover much of the European continent. The European Economic Area (EEA) unites the EU Member States and the three EEA [European Free Trade Association](http://www.efta.int/about-efta/european-free-trade-association) (EFTA) States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) into an internal market governed by the same basic rules. These rules aim to enable goods, services, capital, and persons to move freely about the EEA in an open and competitive environment, a concept referred to as the four freedoms.

Astro has evaluated various options that will allow for the transfer of personal data from the EU/EEA to non-EU/EEA countries. Like many companies, Astro has decided to authorize these personal data transfers using European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses (also referred to as Model Contracts).

Astro uses a new Data Processing Agreement (DPA), which includes Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), also referred to as Model Contracts. These SCCs provide a mechanism approved by the European Commission as offering adequate protection for data subjects when transferring personal data from the EU/EEA under the EU Data Protection Directive. For EU/EEA residents, any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of your information should be directed to Astro by sending an email to [privacy@astro.build](mailto:privacy@astro.build). We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### Security

We understand that the security of your data is important. We provide reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction. However, despite our efforts, no security controls are 100% effective and Astro cannot ensure or warrant the security of your data.

### Links

We may display content that links to third-party websites. We cannot control or be held responsible for third parties’ privacy practices and content. If you click on a third-party advertisement or link, please understand that you are leaving the Astro website and any personal data you provide will not be covered by this Policy. Please read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.

### Changes

Astro may periodically update this policy. We encourage you to periodically review our website for the latest information on our privacy practices.


### Questions

Thank you for reading our Privacy Policy. If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact our Data Protection Officer by emailing [privacy@astro.build](mailto:privacy@astro.build).

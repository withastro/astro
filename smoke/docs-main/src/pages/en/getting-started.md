## Learn Astro

All manner of people come to Astro from different backgrounds bringing with them different learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you'll find this section helpful.

- If you prefer to **learn by doing**, start with our [examples library](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples).
- If you prefer to **learn concepts step by step**, start with our [basic concepts and guides](/en/core-concepts/project-structure).

Like any unfamiliar technology, Astro comes with a slight learning curve. However, with practice and some patience, we know, you _will_ get the hang of it, in no time.

### Learn `.astro` Syntax

When you begin to learn Astro, you'll see many files using the `.astro` file extension. This is **Astro’s Component Syntax**: a special HTML-like file format which Astro uses for templating. It was designed to feel familiar to anyone with HTML or JSX experience.

Our helpful guide on [Astro components](/en/core-concepts/astro-components) introduces you to the Astro syntax, and is the best way to learn.

### API Reference

This documentation section is useful when you want to learn more details about a particular Astro API. For example, [Configuration Reference](/en/reference/configuration-reference) lists all possible configuration options available to you. [Built-in Components Reference](/en/reference/builtin-components) lists all available core components, like `<Markdown />` and `<Code />`.

### Versioned Documentation

This documentation always reflects the latest stable version of Astro. Once we hit the v1.0 milestone, we will add the ability to view versioned documentation.

## Staying Informed

The [@astrodotbuild](https://twitter.com/astrodotbuild) Twitter account is the official source for the updates from the Astro team.

We also post release announcements to our [Discord community](https://astro.build/chat) in the #announcements channel.

Not every Astro release deserves its own blog post, but you can find a detailed changelog for every release in the [`CHANGELOG.md` file in the Astro repository](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/CHANGELOG.md).

## Something Missing?

If something is missing in the documentation or if you found some part confusing, please [file an issue for the documentation](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/new/choose) with your suggestions for improvement, or tweet at the [@astrodotbuild](https://twitter.com/astrodotbuild) Twitter account. We love hearing from you!

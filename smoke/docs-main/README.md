To all who come to this happy place: welcome.

This is the repo for [docs.astro.build](https://docs.astro.build/).
This repo contains all the source code we use to build our docs site.

## We are Astro

Astro is a site builder for the web platform.
We want everyone to be successful building sites, and that means helping everyone understand how Astro works.

You can learn more about Astro, get support, and meet other devs in [our Discord community](https://astro.build/chat).

## Raise an Issue

Is something missing?
Is something wrong?
Could something be better?
Issues are a quick way for you to offer us feedback about the docs.

Before you share, please [see if your issue has already been reported](https://github.com/withastro/docs/issues).

## Edit a Page

Every page on [docs.astro.build](https://docs.astro.build/) has an **Edit this page** button in the sidebar.
You can click that button to edit the source code for that page in **GitHub**.

After you make your changes, click **Commit changes**.
This will automatically create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) of the docs in your GitHub account with the changes.

Once your edits are ready in GitHub, follow the prompts to **create a pull request** and submit your changes for review.
Every pull request needs to be reviewed by our contributors.

If you’re copying these instructions, remember to [configure this project as a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork).

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── demo/
│   ├── public/
│   └── src/
│       └── pages/
│           └── index.astro
└── packages/
    └── my-component/
        ├── index.js
        └── package.json
```

This project uses **workspaces** to develop a single package, `@example/my-component`, from `packages/my-component`. It also includes a `demo` Astro site for testing and demonstrating the component.



## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

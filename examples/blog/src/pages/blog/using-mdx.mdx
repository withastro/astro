This theme comes with the [@astrojs/mdx](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) integration installed and configured in your `astro.config.mjs` config file. If you prefer not to use MDX, you can disable support by removing the integration from your config file.

## Why MDX?

MDX is a special flavor of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. This unlocks the ability to [mix JavaScript and UI Components into your Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive charts or alerts. 

If you have existing content authored in MDX, this integration will hopefully make migrating to Astro a breeze.


## Usage

Quickstart: Add MDX pages to your project by create a new `.mdx` file within your project `src/pages/` directory. 

- [MDX Syntax Documentation](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx)
- [Astro Usage Documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#markdown-and-mdx-pages)

**Note:** [Client Directives](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives) are still required to create interactive components. Otherwise, all components in your MDX will render as static HTML (no JavaScript) by default.

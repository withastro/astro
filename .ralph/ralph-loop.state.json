  "prompt": "# Fixture Consolidation Loop\n\nGoal: consolidate all fixtures under `packages/astro/test/fixtures` into a small set of mega fixtures (target < 10), while preserving all existing test assertions and functionality. No shortcuts, no moving fixtures into “legacy” buckets.\n\nRules:\n\n1. Process fixtures strictly one at a time in alphabetical order.\n2. Before each step, list fixtures with:\n   `ls -1 packages/astro/test/fixtures | sort`\n3. Pick the first fixture in the list that is NOT a mega fixture (mega-ssr, mega-static, mega-routing, mega-frameworks, mega-content) and migrate it.\n4. For each fixture:\n   - Decide the correct mega fixture based on behavior and config.\n   - Move files into the mega fixture structure (preserve paths/behavior).\n   - Update all tests referencing the old fixture root to the new location.\n   - Remove the old fixture directory.\n   - Keep all assertions intact.\n5. Do not skip fixtures, do not batch or reorder.\n6. If a fixture has no tests or references, delete it.\n7. Stop only when the fixtures folder contains ONLY mega fixtures.\n\nCompletion:\nOutput exactly: <promise>RALPH_DONE</promise>\n",

Adds the minimal starter template to the list of `create astro` options

Good news if you're taking the introductory tutorial in docs, making a minimal reproduction, or just want to start a project with as little to rip out as possible. Astro's `minimal` (empty) template is now back as one of the options when running `create astro@latest` and starting a new project!

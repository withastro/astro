Adds new `middlewareMode` adapter feature and deprecate `edgeMiddleware` option

The `edgeMiddleware` option is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release, so users should transition to using the new `middlewareMode` feature as soon as possible.

```diff
export default defineConfig({
  adapter: vercel({
-    edgeMiddleware: true
+    middlewareMode: 'edge'
  })
})
```

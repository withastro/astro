'@astrojs/sitemap': minor
---

Adds a `customSitemaps` option to include extra sitemaps in the `sitemap-index.xml` file generated by Astro.

This is useful for multi-framework setups on the same domain as your Astro site (`example.com`), such as an external blog at `example.com/blog` whose sitemap is generated by another framework.

The following example shows configuring your Astro site to include sitemaps for a externally-generated blog and help center along with the generated sitemap entries in `sitemap-index.xml`:

Example:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import sitemap from '@astrojs/sitemap';

export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://example.com',
  integrations: [
    sitemap({
      customSitemaps: ['https://example.com/blog/sitemap.xml', 'https://example.com/helpcenter/sitemap.xml'],
    }),
  ],
});
```

Adds support for `astro preview` command

Developers can now use `astro preview` to test their Cloudflare Workers application locally before deploying. The preview runs using Cloudflare's workerd runtime, giving you a staging environment that matches production exactly—including support for KV namespaces, environment variables, and other Cloudflare-specific features.

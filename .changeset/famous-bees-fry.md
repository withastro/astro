New Collections API (createCollection)

[BREAKING CHANGE:] The expected return format from createCollection() has been changed. Visit https://docs.astro.build/core-concepts/collections to learn the new API.

This feature was implemented with backwards-compatible deprecation warnings, to help you find and update pages that are using the legacy API.

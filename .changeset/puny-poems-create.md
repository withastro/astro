Increases minimum Node.js version to 20.19.5

Node.js 18 reached end-of-life in March and should not be used. From now on, Astro will only Node.js >=20.19.5, as well as Node.js 22 or later. Node 20 is in maintenance since October so we recommend upgrading to Node.js 22 as soon as possible. See Astro's [Node.js support policy](https://docs.astro.build/en/upgrade-astro/#support) for more details.

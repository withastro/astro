Updates Vite to 7.0

Astro v6.0 upgrades to Vite v7.0 as the development server and production bundler.

#### What should I do?

If you are using Vite-specific plugins, configuration, or APIs, check the [Vite migration guide](https://vite.dev/guide/migration) for their breaking changes and upgrade your project as needed.

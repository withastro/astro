# Report Reproduction Skill

Generate a markdown report summarizing reproduction findings.

## Prerequisites

- `reproduction.json` exists in the triage directory

## Overview

1. Read the reproduction results
2. Generate a markdown report following the template
3. Write to `report.md` in the triage directory

## Step 1: Read Results

Read `triage/<dir>/reproduction.json` to get:
- Whether the issue was reproducible
- Any skip reasons
- Error messages and steps taken
- Notes and observations

Also read `diagnosis.json` if it exists — include partial diagnosis info if available.

## Step 2: Generate Report

Write a markdown report to `triage/<dir>/report.md` following this structure:

### For Reproducible Issues

```markdown
## Automated Triage Report

```

### For Non-Reproducible Issues

```markdown
## Automated Triage Report

**Status:** ❌ Could not reproduce

I attempted to reproduce this issue but was not successful. [Brief description of what was tried.]

### Environment
- **Astro:** [version]
- **Node.js:** [version]

### Steps Attempted
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [etc.]

### Result
[What happened instead — did it work correctly?]

### Possible Reasons
- [Reason 1 — e.g., "May require specific configuration not mentioned"]
- [Reason 2 — e.g., "Could be environment-specific"]

### Suggestions
Could you please provide:
- [ ] A minimal StackBlitz reproduction at https://astro.new/repro
- [ ] Your exact configuration files
- [ ] Full error output with `--verbose` flag

```

### For Skipped Issues

```markdown
## Automated Triage Report

**Status:** ⏭️ Skipped

This issue was not triaged automatically. [Reason]

### Reason: [Skip Reason Title]

[Explanation of why this issue couldn't be automatically triaged]

### Recommendations
[What should happen next — manual review, more info needed, etc.]

---
*This report was generated by automated triage. A maintainer will review shortly.*
```

**Skip reason messages:**
- `host-specific`: "This issue appears to be specific to [provider] deployment. Automated reproduction can only test local development and build. A maintainer with access to [provider] will need to investigate."
- `unsupported-version`: "This issue is for Astro [version] which is no longer actively supported. Please upgrade to Astro 5 or later and confirm if the issue persists."
- `unsupported-runtime`: "This issue appears specific to [runtime]. Automated triage only supports Node.js. A maintainer familiar with [runtime] will need to investigate."
- `no-repro-provided`: "No reproduction was provided. Please create a minimal reproduction at https://astro.new/repro so we can investigate."

## Step 3: Write Output

Write the report to `triage/<dir>/report.md`.

The report should be:
- **Concise** — respect the reader's time
- **Actionable** — clear next steps
- **Friendly** — remember the issue author is trying to help
- **Accurate** — only state what was actually observed
